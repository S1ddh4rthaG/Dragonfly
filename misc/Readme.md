# Misc files

## Details:
- DataParser.js -  Parser that supports directives, specials and labels.
- Instructions.js - Syntax of the implemented instruction types and any exceptions. Can be thought of *rough* grammar
- MemoryModule.js - Contains all the memory related code[read, write, etc.]
- Parser.js - Parser that supports basic instructions and labels.
- Processor.js - Contains the processor code that implements RISC-V core.

## Note:
This code was used for reference and testing of new features. It is not a complete implementation of the RISC-V ISA.
Relics of the test instructions are still present in the code.
